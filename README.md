# awesome-excel-lambda
A bunch of excel lambda functions from scratch to use in your workbook.

## How to use ?

Currently the lambda feature is only available is you are a Office Insider and you have configured the Beta channel.

You have to copy paste the lambda functions. You can put them in the name manager and give them a name to use it in your whole workbook.

## How to contribute ?

Open a pull request and add your lambda with a comment which describe it. Please if you find this formula in a website put a link to it.

Name your parameter with explicit names so that is easier to understand.
